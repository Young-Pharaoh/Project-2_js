# Pig_Game

## Overview
Pig is a simple and fun dice game suitable for 2 or more players. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points.

## Game Components
- **1 Six-sided Die**: A standard die with faces numbered from 1 to 6.
- **Paper and Pencil**: To keep track of scores.

## Setup
1. Each player takes turns rolling the die.
2. Decide who will go first. This can be done by rolling the die; the player with the highest roll starts.

## Game Rules
1. **Rolling the Die**:
   - On a playerâ€™s turn, they roll the die repeatedly.
   - The sum of the numbers rolled is added to their "turn total".

2. **End of a Turn**:
   - The player can choose to "Hold" at any time during their turn. This means they stop rolling and add their turn total to their overall score.
   - However, if the player rolls a **1**, their turn ends immediately, and their turn total is reset to **0**. They do not add any points to their overall score.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach or exceed **100 points** wins the game.

## Strategy Tips
- **Risk vs. Reward**: Weigh the risk of rolling a 1 against the potential reward of adding more points to your turn total.
- **Hold Early or Go Big?**: Some players prefer to hold early to slowly build up their score, while others might prefer to take risks to gain a significant lead.

## Example Turn
- **Player 1** rolls a 3, then a 5, and then a 6. Their turn total is now **14**. They decide to roll again.
- **Player 1** rolls a 1. Unfortunately, their turn ends, and their turn total resets to **0**.
- **Player 2** rolls a 4, a 2, and a 5. Their turn total is **11**. They decide to "Hold" and add **11** points to their overall score.
